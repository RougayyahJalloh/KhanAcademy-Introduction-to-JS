# KhanAcademy-Introduction-to-JS
The assignments assigned to me are preparation for the final exam. This preparation ultimately replaces a large portion of the exam. To complete this assignment: I had to attach the repository with the 7 projects in a repository with screenshots of each one completed.

Within each folder, you will find a document with the my code for the project as well as screenshots or gifs of the projects.
